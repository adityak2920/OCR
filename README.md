# OCR
This project is about image to text conversion i.e, OCR(Optical Character Recognition). BUt I have used phone's camera for
input. For input from phone I have used ipwebcam app which is freely available in Play store, using this app we can stream
video of phone's camera and can extract the video in any device using a IP address. For extracting video in python program I
have used urrlib library to extract from url.
Now for converting image to text, we have used pytesseract library, a python wrapper for tessearct library.
And to read and display video, OpenCV is used.
